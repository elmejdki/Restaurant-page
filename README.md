## Getting started

### Prerequisites

In order to have this project up and running you will need:

- NodeJS 10+

First you need to clone this project using one of the links above, using this command:

`git clone RESPOSITRY_LINK`

Congrats the project is fully working.

_You may have some issues with the `image-webpack-loader`  but that depend on your operating system each operating system has his own way to solve if you goggled it just for some couple minutes I'm sure you will find the solution, if not you can contact me any time you need I will be happy to help, my contact info are below_

### Deployment

for deployment I used gh-pages, but as you see my project is full of files and the `index.html` file is inside the `build/` folder, so in order to deploy using GitHub pages we need to do a simple trick, please follow the commands bellow if you want to deploy on your on repository:

- If you have the `build/ `  folder declared inside the `.gitinore`  file please remove it form there.

- rub `npm run build`  to generate the build folder.

- then make sure that git knows about your subtree:

  ```
  git add build && git commit -m "Initial build subtree commit"
  ```

- use subtree push to send it to gh-pages branch in GitHub:

  ```
  git subtree push --prefix build origin gh-pages
  ```
